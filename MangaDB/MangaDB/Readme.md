# Documentation

We will be using the MVC architecture pattern:

Model: classes that represent app data, enforces buisiness rules and stored state into the db

View: UI logic

Controller: Handles browser requests

## Basics

Program.cs is the file that contains the code to start the server.

Startup.cs has the actual code that starts the service to take http requests.
